Email Sender.

This project doesn't really send emails.
The objetive of this project is to practice with forms, simulating an email sender.

The form filters the information, for example, if the email is not the correct format (email@email.com).
There is a button for remove all the information from the form.
In case of one of the fields is empty and/or the email format isn't right, the send button shows disabled. Otherwise, the button turns avaible.
When you click the submit button pops up a loading animation and after 3 seconds a success message appears. After 5 seconds, the information in the form it's remove.
